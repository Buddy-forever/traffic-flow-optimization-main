# 🚦 Traffic Flow Optimization

A real-time traffic monitoring and optimization system powered by computer vision and intelligent lane analysis. This project detects vehicles in a video feed, counts lane-specific traffic, and applies optimization algorithms to recommend better traffic light timings—ideal for smart city applications and transport research.

---

## 🧠 Core Objective

The main goal of this project is to **simulate and optimize urban traffic flow** using **YOLO-based vehicle detection**, **lane-wise vehicle counting**, and **timing optimization logic**. It aims to:

- Reduce congestion at intersections
- Improve vehicle throughput
- Simulate real-world traffic control with visual feedback

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### ✅ Requirements

* Python 3.8–3.11
* OpenCV
* PyTorch (if YOLO uses a custom model)
* NumPy

### 📦 Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traffic-flow-optimization.git
cd traffic-flow-optimization

# 2. Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Running the Project

To run the traffic optimization pipeline on the sample video:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

By default, this uses:

```python
main("dataset/sample_video.mp4")
```

You can change the path in `main.py` based on your custom input.

## 📊 Example Output

### ▶️ Terminal Output

```
0: 384x640 9 cars, 36.6ms
Speed: 1.2ms preprocess, 36.6ms inference, 0.7ms postprocess
```

Each frame shows:

* Car count per lane
* Frame inference speed
* Total processing time

### 🖼️ Display Output

The program opens a real-time OpenCV window showing:

* Detected vehicles (bounding boxes)
* Lane overlays
* Traffic count per lane
